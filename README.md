## What is Unpaused?

Unpaused is a music guessing game built on top of the Spotify Web API. The core loop: you hear a snippet that starts at **0.1 seconds** and grows with every wrong guess or skip - up to 8 seconds across 6 rounds. Nail the track early for more points.

It started as a random idea me a friend and I had while playing Songless and Bandle and ended up as a **production-grade, full-stack TypeScript application** with three distinct game modes, a real-time multiplayer layer, a daily streak system, and a generated type-safe SDK between the frontend and backend.

### What makes it interesting, technically

- **End-to-end type safety** - NestJS emits an OpenAPI spec on build, and the frontend consumes an auto-generated TypeScript SDK. DTOs change once, types propagate everywhere.
- **Real-time multiplayer** - Socket.io gateway with session-validated connections, presence tracking, debounced disconnects, and per-round state synced through TanStack Query cache invalidation.
- **Security-first auth** - Spotify OAuth with PKCE (no client secret leaves the backend). Refresh tokens are stored **AES-256-GCM encrypted** in Postgres; access tokens live in Redis. Sessions are opaque IDs in httpOnly cookies.
- **Operational polish** - BullMQ background jobs, session-scoped rate limiting, ownership checks on every game endpoint, structured logging with request context, and a transactional decorator backed by `AsyncLocalStorage`.
- **Thoughtful UX** - Web Audio API amplitude tracking drives a reactive play button (no React re-renders), Framer Motion for every transition with `reducedMotion` honored, image-derived ambient glows, and progressive album-art preloading so wins feel instant.

## Game modes

### 🎵 Playlist mode
Pick any playlist from your Spotify library (or your Liked Songs). The game picks a random track and plays progressively longer snippets across 6 rounds.

| Round | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duration | 0.1s | 0.5s | 1s | 2s | 4s | 8s |

Wrong guesses are evaluated for **partial matches** - if you guessed the right artist, the right album, or both, the game tells you so. Round durations are driven by the backend so the client can't cheat.

### ☀️ The Daily Mystery
One song per day, pulled from a set of playlists you configure (defaults to your Liked Songs). Win to extend your streak. Miss a day, streak resets - **unless you have a streak freeze**, earned by answering music-trivia quizzes. Streak math runs in **the user's own IANA timezone**, not the server's, so midnight actually means midnight where you are.

### 🔥 The Speed Run (Gauntlet mode)
Endless, one-snippet-per-track. Pick a difficulty (**5s Easy → 1s Expert**), then see how long you can survive. One wrong guess or skip ends the run. Personal-best and global leaderboard included.

### 🟣 With Friends (real-time multiplayer)
Create a room, share the invite code, and race your friends live. The host picks the round count and playlist; a shared track pool is built once and streamed to all clients. Every player's per-round status updates for everyone else in real time, and the final leaderboard lands the instant the last player finishes.

```

The **frontend never talks to Spotify directly** - all Spotify calls go through the backend so access tokens and refresh tokens stay server-side. The frontend consumes a TypeScript SDK auto-generated from the backend's OpenAPI spec, so every DTO, every enum, every query parameter is typed.

---

## Technical highlights

### Type-safe API contract (zero drift between client and server)

The backend's `scripts/generate-openapi.ts` boots a NestJS app, extracts the Swagger spec, and writes `swagger-spec.json`. `openapi-generator-cli` then emits a `typescript-fetch` SDK into `frontend/sdk/`. A single `pnpm build:sdk` regenerates both.

Result: every frontend call is typed against the actual backend controller - if I rename a DTO field, `tsc --noEmit` fails in CI on the frontend until I re-run codegen.

### Spotify OAuth with PKCE + encrypted refresh tokens at rest

- `AuthService.startLogin()` generates a UUID state + code verifier + SHA-256 code challenge, stores the PKCE state in Redis with a 10-minute TTL.
- `handleCallback()` atomically reads-and-deletes the PKCE entry (single-use), exchanges the code, and encrypts the returned **refresh token with AES-256-GCM** (32-byte hex key from env) before writing it to Postgres.
- Access tokens never touch the database - they live only in Redis, keyed by session, with an expiry that matches Spotify's response.
- Session IDs are UUIDs set as `httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax`, secure-in-prod cookies. `SessionGuard` validates presence and existence on every protected route.

### Session-scoped rate limiting

Out-of-the-box `@nestjs/throttler` limits by IP, which is wrong for a shared-WiFi world. `SessionThrottlerGuard` keys off the session cookie (falling back to IP if there isn't one) and stores counters in Redis. The login/gate endpoints use stricter buckets to deter brute force.

### Ownership checks on every game endpoint

Earlier, any authenticated user could hit `/game/{id}/guess` with another user's game ID and the backend would happily accept it. PR #50 (`ownership checks to game state and guess endpoints`) closed that - every `GameService` method now joins on `userId` and throws `ForbiddenException` when there's a mismatch.

### Timezone-aware daily streaks

`StreakService` never uses `new Date()`-style "server time." It accepts the user's IANA timezone (from `UserPreference.timezone`, auto-detected client-side and confirmed on the preferences page) and computes "today" via `date-fns-tz`. Streak freezes are first-class: if a gap day is found, consumed freezes are recorded in a `StreakFreezeUsage` audit table so the UI can explain exactly which day was saved.

### Multiplayer gateway with debounced host-disconnect

`RoomsGateway` parses the `unpaused_session` cookie on `handleConnection`, validates it against Redis, and **rejects the socket if the session is invalid** - no anonymous sockets. Presence is tracked in-memory per room (`Map<roomId, Set<userId>>`).

When the host disconnects, the gateway doesn't immediately tear down the room - it waits ~3–5s (debounced) to distinguish a tab refresh from an actual leave. This one detail eliminates 90% of the "my host flickered and the room died" bugs.

Round state is stored in Postgres via `MultiplayerGameService`; WebSocket events simply invalidate TanStack Query caches on the clients, which refetch the authoritative state. The server is the single source of truth; the clients are just projections.

### Background jobs

A BullMQ queue (`GAME_CLEANUP_QUEUE`) runs a cron every 6 hours to mark game sessions that have been idle past a threshold as `ABANDONED`, so they stop hanging around in active-game queries and don't count against stats. Exponential-backoff retry is wired in via a shared `JOB_OPTIONS_WITH_BACKOFF`.

### `@Transactional` decorator with `AsyncLocalStorage`

Instead of threading a Prisma client through every service method, a custom `@Transactional()` decorator uses Node's `AsyncLocalStorage` to transparently propagate the active transaction. Every repository call resolves the Prisma client via a proxy - inside a transactional context it returns the `tx`, outside it returns the root client. Service code stays clean; ACID boundaries are explicit at the decorator.

### Reactive audio amplitude without React re-renders

The play button pulses in sync with the music. Done naïvely that's a `setState` every animation frame - ~60 React renders per second of playback. Instead, `useAudioAmplitude` wires an `AnalyserNode` into a **Framer Motion `MotionValue<number>`**; the button subscribes to the motion value and updates CSS directly via the Motion runtime. React never re-renders, but the UI is perfectly reactive.

### iOS/mobile audio handling

Safari blocks `audio.play()` outside a user gesture and tears down the audio context when the tab backgrounds. `useGameAudio` keeps a warmup audio element, re-primes the context on `visibilitychange`, uses monotonic "play request" IDs to discard stale callbacks, and exposes a `MediaSession` handler so lock-screen play/pause doesn't trigger snippet playback mid-round.

### Optimistic updates (without the "flashes wrong then correct" bug)

Submitting a guess optimistically adds it to the `guesses` list so the UI feels instant. Early on, a race condition would briefly render the guess as "Wrong" before the server's actual `Correct/Artist/Album` result arrived (PR #62). The fix: the optimistic guess carries a `pending` flag that suppresses the color-coded result row until the real mutation settles. Small, but a huge feel improvement.

### Preview-URL resilience

Spotify removed anonymous preview URLs from the public API in early 2026 (PR #79). The backend now uses a small scraper service (`PreviewScraperService`) that resolves preview URLs from the web player as a fallback, caches them on the `Track` row, and transparently keeps the game playable.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **pnpm** (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **Docker + Docker Compose**
- A **Spotify Developer app** (free)

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlosverissimo3001/unpaused.git
cd unpaused
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start Postgres + Redis

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This brings up Postgres 16 on `:5432` and Redis 7 on `:6379`, both with healthchecks and persistent volumes.

### 3. Create a Spotify app

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create an app
3. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`
4. Copy the **Client ID** - PKCE flow, so no client secret needed

### 4. Configure env vars

**`backend/.env`**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://unpaused:unpaused_dev@localhost:5432/unpaused?schema=public"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3001/auth/callback"
SESSION_SECRET="generate-a-random-32-char-string"
SESSION_MAX_AGE_SECONDS="604800"
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY="64-character-hex-string"   # openssl rand -hex 32
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# Optional
LAST_FM_API_KEY="..."
CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://..."
```

**`frontend/.env.local`**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3001"
# Optional site-wide password gate
SITE_PASSWORD="..."
```

### 5. Initialize the database

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

### 6. Run both servers

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Frontend → http://localhost:3000
- Backend → http://localhost:3001
- Swagger UI → http://localhost:3001/api
- Prisma Studio → `pnpm db:studio`

## Development workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Runs frontend + backend concurrently |
| `pnpm dev:frontend` / `pnpm dev:backend` | Run just one side |
| `pnpm build` | Production build of both workspaces |
| `pnpm build:sdk` | Regenerate `swagger-spec.json` + frontend SDK |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Regenerate Prisma client after schema changes |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply / create migrations |
| `pnpm db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio against local Postgres |
| `pnpm test` | Run all Jest tests (both workspaces) |
| `pnpm test:backend` / `pnpm test:frontend` | Run one side |

**Anytime you touch a backend DTO or controller signature, run `pnpm build:sdk`.** CI runs the same step on PRs, so drift is caught automatically.

---

## Testing & CI

- **Jest** with `ts-jest` on both workspaces; backend has a spec file colocated with most services (guess evaluator, throttler storage, streak math, etc.).
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and every PR to `main`/`develop`:
  - **Backend job**: Prisma generate → Prettier format check → ESLint → `tsc --noEmit` → Jest (with a test `DATABASE_URL`)
  - **Frontend job**: ESLint → `tsc --noEmit` → Jest
  - Concurrency group cancels stale runs when new commits land.
- **ESLint 9 flat config** with `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises: error` and `curly: [error, all]` - both catches small async bugs that would otherwise slip through.
- **Prettier 3** is CI-enforced; `.prettierignore` skips the generated SDK.

---

## Deployment

- **Frontend** → Vercel. Cookies are same-domain for the API via a reverse-proxy setup, so the browser never needs to send cross-origin credentials.
- **Backend** → Railway (Dockerized NestJS). Postgres and Redis are provisioned add-ons; `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is an environment secret generated via `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- **Production migrations** run via `pnpm --filter backend prisma:migrate-prod` (see `scripts/` in `backend/`), kicked off on deploy.

## Roadmap / What I'd add next

Some things that are scoped but not built (or only partially built):

- **E2E tests** with Playwright that cover the full auth → gameplay → history loop
- **Redis-based pub/sub for multiplayer** so the backend scales horizontally beyond a single Socket.io node
- **Spotify Premium full-track playback** for Premium users so the 30-second preview limit goes away
- **Observability stack** - OpenTelemetry exporters and a proper dashboard (current structured logging is a stepping stone)
- **A11y pass** - keyboard flow is reasonable but I want screen-reader coverage verified top-to-bottom
- **Internationalization** - strings are already centralized, just not wired to a locale loader yet
